LOOM: LLVM instrumentation library
====================================================================

LOOM is a general-purpose library for adding instrumentation to software in
the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) format. It is currently capable of
generating static instrumentation points that expose values (e.g., function
parameters and return values) to software-defined instrumentation functions.

LOOM is part of the
[CADETS research project](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/cadets)
(Causal, Adaptive, Distributed, and Efficient Tracing System).
